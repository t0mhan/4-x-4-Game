            <h3>Game Rules</h3>
            <p>The game can be played using arrow keys. The game reflects the following rules:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>The playing field consists of 4 x 4 fields</li>
               <li>Each field is initialized randomly with the value EMPTY, 1 or 2</li>
               <li>The player can move the playing field with the cursor keys Left, Right, Up, Down.</li>
               <li>
                  Hereby each field moves one field in the corresponding direction. It applies:
                  <ul>
                     <li>A field cannot be moved beyond the edge of the playing field.</li>
                     <li>A field cannot move into its direction, if the field in the corresponding direction <br> is already occupied and does not have the same value.</li>
                     <li>A field can be moved to another field if both values of the fields are identical.</li>
                     <li>If this happens, one field is removed and the value of the other field is doubled.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>After each move, a 1 or 2 is randomly added at the opposite edge of the move direction, on an empty field.</li>
               <li>The game is over when there are no more valid moves</li>
            </ul>
